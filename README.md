# RPG Maker XP RGSS Encryptor

By default the RPG Maker XP encryptor is quite poor and can end up crashing the engine quite a bit when you're attempting to encrypt the archive. This project is suppose to remedy that. To encrypt your project or to generate an `Game.rgssad` file, simply drag the root folder of your game onto the exe and the application will do the rest.
